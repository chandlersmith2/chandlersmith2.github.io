Welcome to my website! I'm a 5th year Ph.D. student at Tufts University, working with <a href='https://abiy-tasissa.github.io/'>Dr. Abiy Tasissa</a>. My mathematical interests are in the general areas of optimization and probability, with my current emphasis being on geometric algorithms for machine learning, as well as a growing interest in computational solutions to inverse problems. Currently, I'm involved in developing fast algorithms for the Euclidean distance matrix completion problem, a relevant problem in sensor network localization, molecular geometry, and dimensionality reduction. I am currently on the academic job market for postdoctoral positions, so if you are interested in working with me feel free to reach out.
