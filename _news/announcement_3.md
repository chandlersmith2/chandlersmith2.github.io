This is a delayed update, but Drs. Abiy Tasissa, HanQin Cai, and myself have uploaded a new paper to arXiv titled "Pr
ovable Non-Convex Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion: Geometry, Reconstruction, and Robustness". This paper substantially improves upon our prior publication, and provides a very nice geometric characterization of EDMC specific incoherence. See [here!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00091)
